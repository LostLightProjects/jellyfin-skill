# Jellyfin
This skill is a fork of the emby skill that allows audio playback from a Jellyfin server

## About
Stream music from your Jellyfin server using Mycroft! Play all songs by an artist or an instant mix of any artist/album/song in your Jellyfin library.

This has been tested on Ubuntu using VLC audio backend.

## Installation
* mycroft-msm install https://github.com/ghostbuster84/jellyfin-mycroft-skill/

## Picroft
You will need to install vlc, installing just vlc-bin will not work which is really annoying.
This requirement might change as mycroft supports more audio backends.
* sudo apt-get install vlc

The common play framework does not work on picroft at the moment as the queries timeout before the request is complete, this is a bug in the playback control skill so for now you will have to use the "from jellyfin" intent, eg; "Play artist Blackmore's Night from jellyfin"

## Common Play Framework
This skill supports the common play framework! This means you don't have to specify "Jellyfin" in your intent. For Example
* "Play The Beatles"
* "Play artist The Beatles"
* "Play playlist fun mix"
* "Play song Hey Jude"
* "Play heavy metal"
* "next song"
* "pause"
* "stop"
* "resume"

## From Intent
If you have other music services you can use the from intent
* "Play artist Blackmore's Night from jellyfin"
* "Play playlist fun mix from jellyfin"
* "Play rock from jellyfin"

## OTHER Features
You can ask for the track information.
* "what song is this"

You can shuffle your music
* "shuffle"

You can add the currently playing song to a playlist(it has to exist)
* "add to (playlist name)"
* "add to fun mix"
