This skill is a fork of the emby skill that allows audio playback from a Jellyfin server.
## About
Stream music from your Jellyfin server using Mycroft! Play all songs by an artist or an instant mix of any artist/album/song in your Jellyfin library.

This has been tested on Zorin OS 16 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) using VLC audio backend, Debian Stable, Fedora Worksation 35 & 36, Lost Light OS and PiCroft using Google AIY Voicekit and VLC (VLC is needed for PiCroft - read down below)

## Community
I now have a Matrix Chat setup and it is bridged to Telegram. Find it on our Website at https://Lostlight.me

## Bugs
* As far as I'm aware, we are bug free!
NOTE: Some albums don't like to play, after extensive testing with the skill, I found out it was a bug on Jellyfin's side. Not the skill. Workaround is to add all songs from the album in question to a dedicated playlist.

## Fixed Issues
* Playlists now play
* Settings in home.mycroft.ai fixed (wasn't showing up)
* Common Play Framework on all devices other than picroft seem to now work
* Individual songs now play as long as there is metadata for it to read, I.E. Name of Song.

## Installation
* mycroft-msm install https://github.com/LostLightProjects/jellyfin-skill/

## Picroft
You will need to install vlc, installing just vlc-bin will not work which is really annoying.
This requirement might change as mycroft supports more audio backends.
* sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
* sudo apt install vlc

The common play framework does not work on picroft at the moment as the queries timeout before the request is complete, this is a bug in the playback control skill so for now you will have to use the "from jellyfin" intent, eg; "Play artist Blackmore's Night from jellyfin"

## Common Play Framework
This skill supports the common play framework! This means you don't have to specify "Jellyfin" in your intent. For Example
* "Play The Beatles"
* "Play artist The Beatles"
* "Play playlist Fun Mix"
* "Play song Fancy Like"
* "Play Country"
* "next song" or "skip song"
* "pause"
* "stop"
* "resume"

## From Intent
If you have other music services you can use the from intent
* "Play artist The Beach Boys from jellyfin"
* "Play playlist Fun Mix from jellyfin"
* "Play Country from jellyfin"
* "Play album Country from Jellyfin"

## OTHER Features
You can ask for the track information.
* "what song is this"

You can shuffle your music
* "shuffle"

You can add the currently playing song to a playlist(it has to exist first)
* "add to (playlist name)"
* "add to fun mix"
